- TCP: Need to be able to cancel connection b/c it sometimes spins forever
- TCP: Access violation due to reachability callback being called after connection is closed
- TCP: Connection timeout is triggered if disconnecting within 5 secs
- TCP: Connection timeout doesn't work if host is unreachable to start with (bogus dns name) -> Network lost in reachability
- Licensing: Also add our own version number
    + flight instruments and many icons stolen from Cleanflight Configurator
    + calibrate icon stolen on the web

- Replay: visual indication of replay (pause/play, FF, REW ?)
- When ARMED, disable Configuration, Motor testing, receiver config?, Modes?, Dataflash
- Alarm: Altitude low and high alarms, RTH fence alarm, Amperage, mAh consumed, etc.
- App icon
- Sexy launch screen and connection page
- Map: Add pin for RTH location
- Map: Allow tapping on drone annotation, change annotation when GPS Fix lost (blink?)
- Map: Tapping on map shows "Go There" button
- Follow Me: only works with Telemetry screen
- Telemetry: Time counter since arming
- Telemetry (map?): Display active profile, battery Amps, mAh consumed/remaining, vertical speed, communication speed
- Settings: Map type (sat, hybrid, map)
- Backup / Restore
(- Telemetry-only mode (passive): MSP_BOXNAMES,MSP_STATUS,MSP_IDENT,MSP_RAW_IMU,MSP_ALTITUDE,MSP_RAW_GPS,MSP_RC,MSP_ATTITUDE,MSP_SERVO. "Almost nobody uses it...")
- Modes: "Plus" buttons don't work well because of frequent table updates
- Pre-flight checks page
- Ability to name models: use cleanflight UID and BT uuid to identify it

- Comm: Test 3DR Telemetry radio (= HKPilot tranceiver telemetry)
- Comm: Use FPV audio channel to transmit data (ImmersionRC EzOSD)

- Background mode: BLE supposedly only wakes up the app "if the peripheral delivers an update" (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/BackgroundExecution/BackgroundExecution.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH4-SW54)
    Wi-Fi: must implement func application(_ application: UIApplication, performFetchWithCompletionHandler completionHandler: (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) in app delegate

DONE:
- Remove borders of text field in config and elsewhere. See Pages
- Replay: disable buttons and tabs that are N/A: Config, Motors, Receiver, Modes, calib, pid, dataflash, about
- Reset AircraftModel when connecting and when starting replay
- Record: For each session, display date
- Licensing: Put this in Settings.app (Acknoledgements)
    + map, tuning, (new calibrate), battery, signal icons "designed by Freepik" mandatory in credits

- MyUINavigationController "Back" button detector doesn't work if launched from "More..." VC
- Units: metrics / imperial
- Record: move to Settings. "Log flight data" on/off will record flight data for every flight
- Replay: dump full AircraftModel at start of session.
- Finish Settings: detect pref changes, set default prefs, etc.
- Record: For each session, display location, distance, duration, max alt, ... (See DJI GO)
- Alarms: GPS Fix and Battery Low only checked in Telemetry VC
- Comm: Detect when no more data is coming in, display alert
