- BUG: ESP8266 lots of comm errors although latency is very low. Why?
- BUG: Time counter not reset after disconnect: 147:18 ????
- Alarm: Altitude low and high alarms, RTH fence alarm, Amperage, mAh consumed, etc.
- TCP/IP: Try UDP instead of TCP
- LED programming
- RC Sticks: Add switches AUX 1-4, display configured modes
- Failsafe: allow to choose configured mode for Aux channels set value
- Replay: When switching to other app or springboard, time counter should be paused
- RC Sticks depend on channel order set in Receiver tuning. Should be independent! Option for Mode 2/Mode 1 may be.
- Mark inactive panels/gauge with red cross
- UAV Health page (sensors, etc.) / Pre-flight checks page -> merge with Calibration
  - GPS Status: fix, num sats
  - RC check
  - Motors check
  - FPV / video check
  - No-fly zone: DJI uses noflyzone.org. Not public. Seems to be only list of airports with radius plus some warning points/areas (stade de france, parc des princes, élysée, etc.) (See http://www.dji.com/flysafe/no-fly and http://www.dji.com/fly-safe/category-mc?www=v1)

    Works but size of airport missing.
  - Battery check
  - Failsafe check
- ESP8266: May be better to create ad-hoc network on iPhone (Personal Hotspot) and have ESP8266 connect to it. Or better yet, use portable access point (DJI Phantom Range Extender).
- Replay: When an internal error happens, not related to the log file; it is trapped and the message says "invalid flight file"
- Replay: visual indication of replay (pause/play, FF, REW ?)
- Map: Allow tapping on drone annotation, change annotation when GPS Fix lost (blink?)
- Telemetry (map?): Display active profile, communication speed?
- Map: Map type (sat, hybrid, map)
- Backup / Restore
- Ability to name models: use cleanflight UID and BT uuid to identify it. Alert levels settings (Alt, Amp, mAh, etc.) are specific to model

- Comm: Use FPV audio channel to transmit data (ImmersionRC EzOSD)
