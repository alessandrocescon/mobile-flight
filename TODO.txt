- RC Sticks: Add switches AUX 1-4, display configured modes
- Failsafe: allow to choose configured mode for Aux channels set value
- Support for cleanflight 1.12: MSP_(SET_)TRANSPONDER_CONFIG (?) supported(1), data, MSP_(SET_)RC_DEADBAND (3), MSP_(SET_)SENSOR_ALIGNMENT(3), MSP_SDCARD_SUMMARY, MSP_(SET_)BLACKBOX_CONFIG, MSP_(SET_)3D
- Replay: When switching to other app or springboard, time counter should be paused
- Spektrum RSSI (firmware): low value even when signal should be ok (Down to 14 on 17/02/16 at 15:47)
- Imperial units: Should be able to choose between NM / kn and mile / mph
- Move Settings into app
- Use adaptive update frequency based on latency/comm bandwidth
- RC Sticks depend on channel order set in Receiver tuning. Should be independent! Option for Mode 2/Mode 1 may be.
- Weather info for current location using METAR (https://aviationweather.gov/gis/scripts/MetarJSON.php?bbox=1,47,4,50&density=all)
- Mark inactive panels/gauge with red cross
- UAV Health page (sensors, etc.) / Pre-flight checks page -> merge with Calibration
  - Calibrate accelerometer
  - Calibrate magnetometer
  - Active sensors
  - GPS Status: fix, num sats
  - RC check
  - Motors check
  - RSSI ?
  - FPV / video check
  - Weather conditions (METAR see above)
  - No-fly zone: DJI uses noflyzone.org. Not public. Seems to be only list of airports with radius plus some warning points/areas (stade de france, parc des princes, élysée, etc.) (See http://www.dji.com/flysafe/no-fly and http://www.dji.com/fly-safe/category-mc?www=v1)
  - Battery check
  - Failsafe check
  - and Accelerometer trim (not really related but don't know where to put it...)
- ESP8266: May be better to create ad-hoc network on iPhone (Personal Hotspot) and have ESP8266 connect to it. Or better yet, use portable access point (DJI Phantom Range Extender).
- Replay: When an internal error happens, not related to the log file; it is trapped and the message says "invalid flight file"
- Licensing: Also add our own version number
    + many icons/images stolen from Cleanflight Configurator
    + calibrate icon stolen on the web
- Replay: visual indication of replay (pause/play, FF, REW ?)
- When ARMED, disable Configuration, Motor testing, receiver config?, Modes?, Dataflash, CLI
- Alarm: Altitude low and high alarms, RTH fence alarm, Amperage, mAh consumed, etc.
- Map: Allow tapping on drone annotation, change annotation when GPS Fix lost (blink?)
- Telemetry (map?): Display active profile, communication speed?
- Map: Map type (sat, hybrid, map)
- Backup / Restore
(- Telemetry-only mode (passive): MSP_BOXNAMES,MSP_STATUS,MSP_IDENT,MSP_RAW_IMU,MSP_ALTITUDE,MSP_RAW_GPS,MSP_RC,MSP_ATTITUDE,MSP_SERVO. "Almost nobody uses it...". Removed in 1.11?)
- Ability to name models: use cleanflight UID and BT uuid to identify it. Alert levels settings (Alt, Amp, mAh, etc.) are specific to model

- Comm: Use FPV audio channel to transmit data (ImmersionRC EzOSD)

- Background mode: BLE supposedly only wakes up the app "if the peripheral delivers an update" (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/BackgroundExecution/BackgroundExecution.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH4-SW54)
    Wi-Fi: must implement func application(_ application: UIApplication, performFetchWithCompletionHandler completionHandler: (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) in app delegate

    iPad2 (No BLE support)
    iPhone 4S
    new iPad
    iPod Touch (5th gen)
    iPad mini

DONE:
- Remove borders of text field in config and elsewhere. See Pages
- Replay: disable buttons and tabs that are N/A: Config, Motors, Receiver, Modes, calib, pid, dataflash, about
- Reset AircraftModel when connecting and when starting replay
- Record: For each session, display date
- Licensing: Put this in Settings.app (Acknoledgements)
    + map, tuning, (new calibrate), battery, signal icons "designed by Freepik" mandatory in credits
    + compass: <div>Icons made by <a href="http://www.flaticon.com/authors/yannick" title="Yannick">Yannick</a> from <a href="http://www.flaticon.com" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a>             is licensed by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="Creative Commons BY 3.0">CC BY 3.0</a></div>
- MyUINavigationController "Back" button detector doesn't work if launched from "More..." VC
- Units: metrics / imperial
- Record: move to Settings. "Log flight data" on/off will record flight data for every flight
- Replay: dump full AircraftModel at start of session.
- Finish Settings: detect pref changes, set default prefs, etc.
- Record: For each session, display location, distance, duration, max alt, ... (See DJI GO)
- Alarms: GPS Fix and Battery Low only checked in Telemetry VC
- Comm: Detect when no more data is coming in, display alert
- Comm: AppDelegate timer should not be on main queue -> when UI is busy, timer is not firing. -> solution: Main run loop, yes, but not in default mode
- TCP: Connection timeout is triggered if disconnecting within 5 secs
- TCP: Need to be able to cancel connection b/c it sometimes spins forever
- TCP: Connection timeout doesn't work if host is unreachable to start with (bogus dns name) -> Network lost in reachability
- TCP: Access violation due to reachability callback being called after connection is closed
Disconnected drone+dongle. Cannot dismiss "Connection lost. Reconnecting". Log:

Then BAD_ACCESS_EXCEPTION in reachability callback
- Comm: 0.5 sec receive timeout is too short. 0.75 -> 1 sec?
- Comm: Disconnecting with "no data received" dialog visible, doesn't hide it
- Telemetry2: Need to retrieve Misc(?) for battery ranges
- Telemetry: Time counter since arming
- Comm: Test 3DR Telemetry radio (= HKPilot tranceiver telemetry)
- Initial handshake very unstable with 3dr. BOXNAMES message beginning is truncated/doesn't come through.
Investigation shows that small packets (<=32 bytes) are reliable but success rate decreases starting with 64-byte packets:
packet size         error rate
16                  0
32                  0
64                  0.05 ?
72                  1/[15-20]
80                  1/12
96                  worse
128                 worst

Implementing some post-1.8 fixes seem to help a lot: https://github.com/Dronecode/SiK/commit/546e1ab09595ea5cff9bfd7bb912a4ae4c0202e0#diff-a940a548ba41bc988f99d51fd02f21de
Now running 1.9+ with Multiwii patches. Seems to work fine.
- Follow Me: only works with Telemetry screen
- Telemetry (map?): Display battery Amps, mAh consumed
- Variometer
- Map: Draw heading of drone on map. Using arrow shape instead of circle.
- Modes: "Plus" buttons don't work well because of frequent table updates
- When communication is interrupted, check that outgoing msgs do not accumulate in outgoing buffer
- BEFORE RELEASE: Remove/hide Dataflash tab
- Show when vehicle ARMED/DISARMED
- Receiver: colors mismatched b/c of row re-use?
- RC STicks: issue when view disappearing -> commands not provided back when visible.
- Switching quickly (?) WHEN RC STICKS ARE ON to Map -> Bottom nav bar is hidden. No way to navigate.
- App icon
- Sexy launch screen and connection page
- CF can issue $M! packets for error cases. Happens for unknown MSP codes (or not compiled-in such as GPS in betaflight)
- CLI support
- Spurious network reachability callback, way after tcp/ip connection was closed
- Replay: NSKeyedArchiver throws NPE on invalid (truncated) archive
- RC Sticks: confusing. Users expect them to show the current sticks position
- Alt Hold and Mag Hold bugs are not refreshed when updated by the FC (using sticks or GPS NAV)
- Flight Recorder: add data/time of session in file
- Speed, altitude indicator and variometer are in metric units, regardless of user settings
- Replay: detailed row: the DTH icon is in blue in some cases
- Switch to nautical mile for DTH when > 1 mile
- iPhone 4 support: No because BLE not supported
- Started app: switched to bluetooth tab, cannot refresh b/c "Refreshing..." disabled -> Bluetooth was turned off. Working as designed. iOS pops up an alert to enable Bluetooth.
- Map: Add pin for RTH location and current Pos Hold
- Map: Tapping on map shows "Go There" button -> Waypoint
- PID tuning: support for MSP_SET_RESET_CURR_PID (1.12+)
- Telemetry: Air mode indicator
- StaticDataTableViewController: Section footers are not hidden (https://github.com/peterpaulis/StaticDataTableViewController/issues/18)
- Support for cleanflight 1.12: failsafe config (MSP_(SET_)RXFAIL_CONFIG, MSP_(SET_)FAILSAFE_CONFIG, MSP_(SET_)RXFAIL_CONFIG
