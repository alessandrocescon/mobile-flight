        <h1>Privacy Policy for Mobile Flight</h1>
        <p> Raphael Jean-Leconte built the Mobile Flight app as a Free app. This service is provided by
        Raphael Jean-Leconte at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
        <p>Mobile Flight does not collect personally identifiable information, but it collects non-personally
            identifiable information using third party services. This is the list of third party services used
            in Mobile Flight:</p>
        <h2>Google Firebase</h2>
        <p>Mobile Flight uses Firebase Analytics to collect app usage statistics. I use this usage
        statistics to improve the app. Firebase Analytics can be disabled in the settings of Mobile Flight.</p>
        <h3>Which data is collected?</h3>
        <p>The information collected through Firebase Analytics's default implementation includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the number of users and sessions</li>
            <li>session duration</li>
            <li>operating systems</li>
            <li>device models</li>
            <li>geography</li>
            <li>first launches</li>
            <li>app opens</li>
            <li>app updates</li>
            <li>in-app purchases</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, Mobile Flight collects the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>type and version of flight controller firmware</li>
            <li>flight controller board type</li>
            <li>connection type (Wifi or Bluetooth)</li>
            <li>enabled features</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Firebase SDK library uses an app-instance identifier to Identify a unique installation of the App.</p>
        <p>With Mobile Flight, the SDK will collect the Vendor Identifier for this purpose.</p>
        <h2>Google Crashlytics</h2>
        <p>In a case of an error in the app I collect data and information through Google Crashlytics.
        I use this information to identify problems in the app and correct them.
        Crashlytics data collection can be disabled in the settings of Mobile Flight.</p>
        <h3>What information does Crashlytics collect from End Users?</h3>
        <p>Crashlytics automatically collects certain information that does not personally identify End Users
        who access or use mobile applications that use Crashlytics. This information includes, but is not
        limited to, device state information, unique device identifiers, device hardware and OS information,
        information relating to how an application functions, and the physical location of a device at the time
        of a crash.</p>
